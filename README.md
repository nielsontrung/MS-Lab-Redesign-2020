MS Lab Redesign 2020
## Inspiration
First floor ms feels cramped and lacks natural lighting. My inspiration is to open up the space by moving the turtorial rooms to one side and opening up common space for more computers.

## What it does
Opening up the space will give a more modern feel and the natural lighting will boost the atmosphere.

## How I built it
I used unreal engine to render the environment and downloaded and exported 3d models in 2d studio max.

## Challenges I ran into
Sometimes exporting and importing models rendered from 3d studio max into unreal engine didn't format properly.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Learning basic 3d modeling.

## What I learned
During my lab redesign process I learned basics of 3d modeling

## What's next for Lab Redesign
I recently discovered that uofc has a minor in architectural studies and might consider
applying for the minor program
